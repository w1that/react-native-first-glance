### The first app I started writing with react native. I took the design inspiration from dribbble.com. 
### So far, I have completed the login screen of the shopping application by coding its similar aspects with Reactjs

#### I made a hardcoded products and categories list. Datas come from there.

### First sight of the app:

### After create product detail screen:

## TODOS:
 #### When pressed on products, user will be navigated detail screen of the product. âœ“ 
 #### The buttons on the app bar above should be interactive.
